# Laravel Projects

This repository contains all my Laravel side projects. Each project demonstrates different features and patterns using the Laravel framework.  
**All projects use PostgreSQL as the database engine.**

## Projects

- [api_project_laravel](./api_project_laravel): A basic API with authentication.
- [bussiness-project](./bussiness-project): A basic business project that uses resources to map data, similar to the repository pattern.
- [count_sanct](./count_sanct): A basic project that uses DataTables, AJAX, models, and demonstrates relationships between tables.
